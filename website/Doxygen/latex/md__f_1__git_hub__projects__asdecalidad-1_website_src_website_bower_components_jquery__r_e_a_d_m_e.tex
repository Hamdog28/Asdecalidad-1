j\+Query is a fast, small, and feature-\/rich Java\+Script library. \end{quote}


For information on how to get started and how to use j\+Query, please see \href{http://api.jquery.com/}{\tt j\+Query\textquotesingle{}s documentation}. For source files and issues, please visit the \href{https://github.com/jquery/jquery}{\tt j\+Query repo}.

If upgrading, please see the \href{https://blog.jquery.com/2017/03/20/jquery-3-2-1-now-available/}{\tt blog post for 3.\+2.\+1}. This includes notable differences from the previous version and a more readable changelog.

\subsection*{Including j\+Query}

Below are some of the most common ways to include j\+Query.

\subsubsection*{Browser}

\paragraph*{Script tag}


\begin{DoxyCode}
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
\end{DoxyCode}


\paragraph*{Babel}

\href{http://babeljs.io/}{\tt Babel} is a next generation Java\+Script compiler. One of the features is the ability to use E\+S6/\+E\+S2015 modules now, even though browsers do not yet support this feature natively.


\begin{DoxyCode}
import $ from "jquery";
\end{DoxyCode}


\paragraph*{Browserify/\+Webpack}

There are several ways to use \href{http://browserify.org/}{\tt Browserify} and \href{https://webpack.github.io/}{\tt Webpack}. For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project\textquotesingle{}s documention. In the script, including j\+Query will usually look like this...


\begin{DoxyCode}
var $ = require("jquery");
\end{DoxyCode}


\paragraph*{A\+MD (Asynchronous Module Definition)}

A\+MD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend \href{http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html}{\tt require.\+js\textquotesingle{} documentation}.


\begin{DoxyCode}
define(["jquery"], function($) \{

\});
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Node}

To include j\+Query in \href{nodejs.org}{\tt Node}, first install with npm.


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install jquery
\end{DoxyCode}


For j\+Query to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom}{\tt jsdom}. This can be useful for testing purposes.


\begin{DoxyCode}
require("jsdom").env("", function(err, window) \{
    if (err) \{
        console.error(err);
        return;
    \}

    var $ = require("jquery")(window);
\});
\end{DoxyCode}
